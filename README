Songlist is a database application for keeping track of songs.

It includes code for setting up a MySQL database and a C++ program for
generating text output.  The output format it uses is (plain) TeX.

It is designed specifically for the needs of the author, but it
might be useful for other people and could be easily adapted, so
I've decided to make it publicly available at GitHub.

Please contact the author with any questions.
See email address above.
