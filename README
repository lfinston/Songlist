Songlist is a database application for keeping track of songs.

It includes code for setting up a MySQL database and a C++ program for
generating text output.  The output format it uses is (plain) TeX.

It is designed specifically for the needs of the author, but it
might be useful for other people and could be easily adapted, so
I've decided to make it publicly available at GitHub.

Please contact the author with any questions.
See email address above.

The easiest way to set up the database is to use the file `dump.sql' in the
top-level directory ([...]/Songlist/):

   mysql> source dump.sql

Of course, a MySQL user must be created and permissions must
be granted to it in order to set up and use the database.

For instructions on using MySQL see the MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual:
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-8.0-en/index.html

For specific information on using "mysql â€” The MySQL Command-Line Client"
see: 
https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/mysql-8.0-en/mysql.html

The file [...]/Songlist/database/songlist.sql contains the SQL code
that the author uses to send queries to the database (for adding
songs, etc.).  It is NOT meant to be "sourced".  Sourcing it will
almost certainly result in errors.

The directory `/Songlist/public_domain/' contains PDF files containing
lead sheets for songs that are in the public domain in both the USA and Germany.
See the file `/Songlist/public_domain/README' for more information.

In addition, the directory `/Songlist/lead_sheets/' contains hand-written
lead sheets by the author of songs that are in the public domain
in both the USA and Germany.
