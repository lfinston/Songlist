Add code to make it possible to put multiple circles with gray letters next to each other.

Revise the \song macro so that it uses registers instead of arguments.

Program something for authors.

vector<int> authors_words
vector<int> authors_music

Add string for outputting names differently from 
the way they're stored in database, e.g., "Jimmy Johnson" for
"James P. Johnson".

1.  Determine if single author wrote words and music.

2. Determine if multiple authors all wrote words and music, i.e.,
   vectors for words and music for a given song are identical.

   This case usually means words and music are not specified separately
   for a given song.

3.  Otherwise, output separately.
