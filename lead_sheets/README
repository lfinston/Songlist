polowtnz.pdf:  Polovetsian Dances (No. 1, "Auf den Fluegeln linden Zephyrs") from Prince Igor by
               Alexander Borodin.  This is the melody used by Robert Wright and George Forrest in
	       the song "Stranger is Paradise" from the musical Kismet (1953).  This lead sheet
	       is based on the original, _not_ the version from Kismet, which contains a section
	       (the bridge?) with original music by Wright and Forrest.
