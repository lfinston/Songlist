Canada (also China (including Hong Kong), South Africa)

    A work is in the public domain if the last surviving
    author/editor/librettist has been dead for over 50 years.
    Example: Any work by Sergey Prokofiev is in the public domain
    in Canada, since he died in 1953.  In Canada only, a work
    first published after the death of the last surviving
    author/editor/librettist may be copyrighted for up to 50 years
    after the date of first publication.

United States

    Any work first published before 1926 (as of 2021) is in the public domain.
        Example: Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No.1 is public domain in
        the US, since it was published in 1912.  Any work first
        published from 1926 to 1977 is subject to a 95-year term of
        copyright (As long as a renewal 28 years after first
        publication was filed on time!)  Any work first published 1978
        and later is subject to a term of life of the last surviving
        author plus 70 years.

European Union (also South Korea, Japan)

    A work is in the public domain if the last surviving
        author/editor/librettist has been dead for over 70 years.
        Example: Any work by Maurice Ravel is public domain in the EU,
        since he died in 1937.  However, in France, protection of
        musical works enjoys special time extension compensating for
        the war period (WWI and WWII). For composers who died before
        January 1, 1995, the time protection after death is 78 years
        and 120 days for works published between January 1, 1921 and
        December 31, 1947 and 84 years and 272 days for works
        published until December 31, 1920. This is why none of Ravel’s
        work is public domain in France while it is so in many
        European countries.  A work first published after the death of
        the last surviving author/editor/librettist is subject to
        copyright protection of at least 25 years after first
        publication. See details on Posthumous Publication (Editio
        Princeps).

Rule of the Shorter Term

In Berne signatory countries

This rule basically states that if a work is in the public domain in
the country of origin, it is also public domain in any country that
signed the Berne Convention. This rule has not been adopted by the USA
or Canada. 

The European Union applies the Rule of the Shorter Term for works
whose country of origin is outside the EU. Thus, a work by an American
composer which entered the public domain in the USA, is public domain
in the EU. Under the Berne treaty, the Country of Origin is defined as
the country of first publication of a given work.
