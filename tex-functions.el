;; LDF 2002.11.16.  Added texi2dvi-file-ldf.  I haven't defined any variables
;; for running texi2dvi on particular files, so texi2dvi-file-ldf always runs
;; texi2dvi on the file associated with the current buffer.  
;; I've given it the suffix "-ldf" because I think texinfo-mode may include 
;; a function of the same name someday, if it doesn't already exist in a newer 
;; version of GNU Emacs.

;; LDF 2003.01.19.  Added conditional code for running TeX instead of texi2dvi. 
;; See documentation string below.

;; LDF 2003.03.12.  Changed, so that the buffer local variable run-texi2dvi-on-file
;; can be used in a local variables list for running texi2dvi-file-ldf on a 
;; file different from the one associated with the current buffer.

;; LDF 2003.08.15.  Changed, so that the files examples.web and
;; extext.tex are moved to the directory above.  This
;; accounts for changes made in
;; the file ~/metafont/metapost/perspective/DOCUMENTATION/3DLDFman.texi. 
;; On the gwdg-wb01 under Linux, I was unable to get TeX to write onto
;; a file in the directory above.  It also wasn't possible to get
;; texi2dvi-file-ldf to move the files by using rename-file.  The
;; reason is, that texi2dvi (or tex, depending on the value of arg) is
;; run in a comint-shell, and I don't know of a way to suspend
;; execution of the Emacs-Lisp code until texi2dvi (or tex) is
;; finished.  It would be possible to do this with one of the other
;; methods of running shell commands, but I like to have the
;; comint-shell.
