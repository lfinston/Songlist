The files public_domain_1.pdf, public_domain_2.pdf, public_domain_3.pdf, public_domain_4.pdf
public_domain_5.pdf and public_domain_6.pdf contain lead sheets for songs in the public domain
in both the USA and Germany.

They are divided into multiple files because a single file would be too large to store
in GitHub and also too large for the author to send by email.

It is, however, possible to generate a single file containing all of the public domain lead sheets.

`public_domain_full.pdf' can be generated from `public_domain_full.dvi' with this command:

   dvipdfmx public_domain_full.dvi

The `.eps' (Encapsulated PostScript) files must be in the current directory.  If you've cloned
the Git repository, they should be.

`dvipdfmx' is included in the TexLive distribution.  If you don't have TexLive, see the following
website for more information:  http://tug.org/texlive/

See the file Makefile for rules for generating public_domain_full.dvi, public_domain_full.ps and
public_domain_full.pdf.

The files public_domain_full.tex and public_domain_full.dvi are included in the Git repository.
The file public_domain_full.tex can be used to generate the files public_domain_full.dvi,
public_domain_full.ps and public_domain_full.pdf, whereby the DVI file is already included
in the repository.  As of 2021.08.11., public_domain_full.dvi is only 91628 bytes long.
Of course, it doesn't actually include the scanned images of the lead sheets, but only references
to them, unlike the PostScript and PDF files.  As of this date, public_domain_full.pdf is
80,037,129 bytes in size (> 80 MB) while public_domain_full.ps is 146,009,277 bytes in size
(> 146 MB).  The latter two files are therefore not included in the Git repository.
