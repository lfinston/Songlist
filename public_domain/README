The files public_domain_1.pdf, public_domain_2.pdf, public_domain_3.pdf, public_domain_4.pdf
public_domain_5.pdf and public_domain_6.pdf contain lead sheets for songs in the public domain
in both the USA and Germany.

They are divided into multiple files because a single file would be too large to store
in GitHub and also too large for the author to send by email.
